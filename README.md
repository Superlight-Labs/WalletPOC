## 🐐 Description 
 
This repository acts as a Proof of Concept for the application that is the final product of this project.
The Goals of the whole project, which are explained down below, are ambitious. To make sure our goals are within reach of the team and to make sure
the existing ecosystem and technologies are matured enough, this Proof of Concept was built to implement each use-case in a minimal way.
 
<p align="right"><a href="#readme-top">🔝</a></p>

## 🚀 Unique Features

### Free transactions

Send, receive or do whatever you want with your stablecoins, for free. (Additional tokens included)

### Fully banking compatible

Don’t be cut off. Use SEPA and Wiretransfer, without owning Fiat.
Debitcards are in the planning.

### No Know-How required

You don’t know anything about blockchains? That's not necessary. We abstract all the complicated stuff away.

<p align="right"><a href="#readme-top">🔝</a></p>

## ✅ Goals of this Prototype

1. Fully non-custodial wallet
2. High Security by relying on Multi Party Computation (Based on [Unbounds C++ MPC Library](https://github.com/unboundsecurity/blockchain-crypto-mpc))
3. Use of known and established handling such as in mobile banking apps
4. No requirements of new know-how by users
5. Complete gasless (free) transfers of stablecoins (including various other tokens)
6. Full interoperability between the blockchain and traditional banking part - but without having to own FIAT (utilizing [Circle](https://www.circle.com/en/))
7. Absolute transparency through building in public (open source github repository)

<p align="right"><a href="#readme-top">🔝</a></p>

## ⚒️ Goals for the Future

1. Audit Security
2. Streamline USDC/Polygon features via new UI
3. Fully Leverage Paymaster to enable free transactions
4. Fully interop between FIAT and Crypto by providing a Debit Card

## 🧱 Building Blocks

This Project is built as a Monorepo. The main parts of this Application each have a separate sub-directory. They could be moved to their own repository at any moment.
